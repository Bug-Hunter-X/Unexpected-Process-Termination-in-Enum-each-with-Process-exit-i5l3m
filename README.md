This example showcases a subtle error in Elixir that can occur when using `Enum.each` in conjunction with `Process.exit`.  The program attempts to iterate over a list and print each element. However, if the element is equal to 3, it forcefully terminates the current process using `Process.exit(self(), :kill)`. This leads to the loop halting prematurely and not processing elements after the '3'. The solution demonstrates how to gracefully handle this situation.
